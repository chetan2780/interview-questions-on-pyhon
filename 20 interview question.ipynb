    "Find and read 20 interview questions for Data Types, Operators, Conditional Statements, Looping Statements, Functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)What is break, continue and pass in Python?\n",
    "Break: The break statement terminates the loop immediately and the control flows to the statement after the body of the loop.\n",
    "Continue: The continue statement terminates the current iteration of the statement, skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and the control flows to the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "Pass: As explained above, the pass keyword in Python is generally used to fill up empty blocks and is similar to an empty statement represented by a semi-colon in languages such as Java, C++, Javascript, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What is slicing in Python?\n",
    " ans :As the name suggests, ‘slicing’ is taking parts of.\n",
    "    Syntax for slicing is [start : stop : step]\n",
    "    start is the starting index from where to slice a list or tuple\n",
    "    stop is the ending index or where to sop.\n",
    "    step is the number of steps to jump.\n",
    "    Default value for start is 0, stop is number of items, step is 1.\n",
    "    Slicing can be done on strings, arrays, lists, and tuples.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3)What does *args and **kwargs mean?\n",
    "Ans:*args\n",
    "*args is a special syntax used in the function definition to pass variable-length arguments.\n",
    "“*” means variable length and “args” is the name used by convention. You can use any other.\n",
    "def multiply(a, b, *argv):\n",
    "   mul = a * b\n",
    "   for num in argv:\n",
    "       mul *= num\n",
    "   return mul\n",
    "print(multiply(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) #output: 120\n",
    "**kwargs\n",
    "\n",
    "**kwargs is a special syntax used in the function definition to pass variable-length keyworded arguments.\n",
    "Here, also, “kwargs” is used just by convention. You can use any other name.\n",
    "Keyworded argument means a variable that has a name when passed to a function.\n",
    "It is actually a dictionary of the variable names and its value.\n",
    "def tellArguments(**kwargs):\n",
    "   for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
    "       print(key + \": \" + value)\n",
    "tellArguments(arg1 = \"argument 1\", arg2 = \"argument 2\", arg3 = \"argument 3\")\n",
    "#output:\n",
    "# arg1: argument 1\n",
    "# arg2: argument 2\n",
    "# arg3: argument 3\n",
    "\n",
    "4) What are negative indexes and why are they used?\n",
    "Ans: Negative indexes are the indexes from the end of the list or tuple or string.\n",
    "     Arr[-1] means the last element of array Arr[]\n",
    "     arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "     #get the last element\n",
    "     print(arr[-1]) #output 6\n",
    "     #get the second last element\n",
    "     print(arr[-2]) #output 5\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Explain Inheritance in Python with an example?\n",
    "Ans :As Python follows an object-oriented programming paradigm, classes in Python have the ability to inherit the properties of another class. This process is known as inheritance. Inheritance provides the code reusability feature. The class that is being inherited is called a superclass or the parent class, and the class that inherits the superclass is called a derived or child class. The following types of inheritance are supported in Python.\n",
    "Single inheritance: When a class inherits only one superclass.\n",
    "Multiple inheritance: When a class inherits multiple superclasses.\n",
    "Multilevel inheritance: When a class inherits a superclass, and then another class inherits this derived class forming a ‘parent, child, and grandchild’ class structure.\n",
    "Hierarchical inheritance: When one superclass is inherited by multiple derived classes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6)What are functions in Python?\n",
    "Ans:A function is a block of code which is executed only when a call is made to the function. def keyword is used to define a particular function as shown below:\n",
    "def function():\n",
    "print(\"Hi, Welcome to Intellipaat\")\n",
    "function(); # call to the function\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "Hi, Welcome to Intellipaat\n",
    "\n",
    "7) What are the common built-in data types in Python?\n",
    "Ans:Python supports the below-mentioned built-in data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable data types:\n",
    "a)Number\n",
    "b)String\n",
    "c)Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable data types:\n",
    "a)List\n",
    "b)Dictionary\n",
    "c)set\n",
    "\n",
    "8)What is a dictionary in Python?\n",
    "Ans :Python dictionary is one of the supported data types in Python. It is an unordered collection of elements. The elements in dictionaries are stored as key–value pairs. Dictionaries are indexed by keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, below we have a dictionary named ‘dict’. It contains two keys, Country and Capital, along with their corresponding values, India and New Delhi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "dict={‘Country’:’India’,’Capital’:’New Delhi’, }\n",
    "Output: Country: India, Capital: New Delhi\n",
    "\n",
    "9)What are Python packages?\n",
    "Ans :A Python package refers to the collection of different sub-packages and modules based on the similarities of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "10)What is a map function in Python?\n",
    "Ans:The map() function in Python has two parameters, function and iterable. The map() function takes a function as an argument and then applies that function to all the elements of an iterable, passed to it as another argument. It returns an object list of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def calculateSq(n):\n",
    "return n*n\n",
    "numbers = (2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "result = map( calculateSq, numbers)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "11)Is python case sensitive?\n",
    "Ans:Yes,Python is a case sensitive language.This means that Function and function both are different in python alike SQL and Pascal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "12)Explain split(), sub(), subn() methods of “re” module in Python?\n",
    "Ans:These methods belong to the Python RegEx or ‘re’ module and are used to modify strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "split(): This method is used to split a given string into a list.\n",
    "sub(): This method is used to find a substring where a regex pattern matches, and then it replaces the matched substring with a different string.\n",
    "subn(): This method is similar to the sub() method, but it returns the new string, along with the number of replacements.\n",
    "\n",
    "13)What are the generators in python?\n",
    "Ans:Generator refers to the function that returns an iterable set of items.\n",
    "    \n",
    "14)What does len() do?\n",
    "Ans:len() is an inbuilt function used to calculate the length of sequence like list,string and array.\n",
    "\n",
    "my _list=[1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "len(my_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "15)Define encapsulation in Python?\n",
    "Ans:encapsulation in Python refers to the process of wrapping up the variables and different functions into a single entity or capsule.Python class is the best example of encapsulation in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "16) What is Polymorphism in Python?\n",
    "Ans:Polymorphism is the ability of the code to take multiple forms. Let’s say, if the parent class has a method named XYZ then the child class can also have a method with the same name XYZ having its own variables and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "17) What is self in Python?\n",
    "Ans:Self is an object or an instance of a class. This is explicitly included as the first parameter in Python. On the other hand, in Java it is optional. It helps differentiate between the methods and attributes of a class with local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self variable in the init method refers to the newly created object, while in other methods, it refers to the object whose method was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class A:\n",
    "def func(self):\n",
    "print(“Hi”)\n",
    "\n",
    "18)What is the difference between append() and extend() methods?\n",
    "Both append() and extend() methods are methods used to add elements at the end of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "append(element): Adds the given element at the end of the list that called this append() method\n",
    "extend(another-list): Adds the elements of another list at the end of the list that called this extend() method.\n",
    "    \n",
    "19)What is the difference between / and // operator in Python?\n",
    "Ans: /: is a division operator and returns the Quotient value.\n",
    "10/3\n",
    "o/p:3.33\n",
    "\n",
    "// : is known as floor division operator and used to return only the value of quotient before decimal\n",
    "10//3\n",
    "o/p:3\n",
    "\n",
    "20)What are Python namespaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A namespace in python refers to the name which is assigned to each object in python. The objects are variables and functions. As each object is created, its name along with space(the address of the outer function in which the object is), gets created. The namespaces are maintained in python like a dictionary where the key is the namespace and value is the address of the object. There 4 types of namespace in python-\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in namespace– These namespaces contain all the built in objects in python and are available whenever python is running.\n",
    "Global namespace– These are namespaces for all the objects created at the level of the main program.\n",
    "Enclosing namespaces– These namespaces are at the higher level or outer function.\n",
    "Local namespaces– These namespaces are at the local or inner function."
